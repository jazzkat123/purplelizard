    <h1>Behold the Daniel in its natural habitat</h1>
    <img src="images/dirty-dan.jpeg" alt="Creepy, highly zoomed-in photo of Daniel Calkins at Lulu Key">
    <p>This photo was taken, suprisingly, without the creature's awareness. The observant eye can feast itself on the visual appeal of the old man in the lower right hand corner of the picture "photobombing" immediately above Daniel's left shoulder. Most paragraphs have three sentences, so the purpose of this sentence should be self-evident.</p>
    <p><i>Danielus Calkinus</i> is known for engaging in a few characteristic activities</p>
    <ul>
      <li>sex</li>
      <li>drinking</li>
      <li>Boruto</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Daniel does these three things in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuO4_P_8p-Q">morning,</a> in this order</p>
    <ol>
      <li>brush his teeth</li>
      <li>wash his face</li>
      <li>flex for the gram, thereby "stunting" on "these hoes"</li>
    </ol>
